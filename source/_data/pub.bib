             since empirical potentials are not able to reproduce well the
             properties of both a semiconducting solid and metallic liquid. On the
             other hand, nucleation is a rare event that occurs in much longer
             timescales than those achievable by ab{~}initio molecular dynamics. To
             address this problem, we train a deep neural network potential based
             on a set of data generated by metadynamics simulations using a
             classical potential. We show how this is an effective way to collect
             all the relevant data for the process of interest. In order to
             efficiently drive the crystallization process, we introduce a new
             collective variable based on the Debye structure factor. We are able
             to encode the long-range order information in a local variable which
             is better suited to describe the nucleation dynamics. The reference
             energies are then calculated using the strongly constrained and
             appropriately normed (SCAN) exchange-correlation functional, which is
             able to get a better description of the bonding complexity of the Si
             phase diagram. Finally, we recover the free energy surface with a

             properties near the melting point, obtaining a good agreement with
             experimental data. In addition, we study the early stages of the

             solution, which conserves the dynamic as well as structural properties
             of the underlying atomistic system. The CG modeling is built upon the
             framework of the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). The key is to
             determine each term in the GLE by directly linking it to atomistic
             data. In particular, we propose a two-stage Gaussian process-based
             Bayesian optimization method to infer the non-Markovian memory kernel
             from the data of the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF).
             Considering that the long-time behaviors of the VACF and memory kernel
             for polymer solutions can exhibit hydrodynamic scaling (algebraic
             decay with time), we further develop an active learning method to
             determine the emergence of hydrodynamic scaling, which can accelerate
             the inference process of the memory kernel. The proposed methods do
             not rely on how the mean force or CG potential in the GLE is
             constructed. Thus, we also compare two methods for constructing the CG
             potential: a deep learning method and the iterative Boltzmann
             inversion method. With the memory kernel and CG potential determined,
             the GLE is mapped onto an extended Markovian process to circumvent the
             expensive cost of directly solving the GLE. The accuracy and
             computational efficiency of the proposed CG modeling are assessed in a
             model star-polymer solution system at three representative
             concentrations. By comparing with the reference atomistic simulation
             results, we demonstrate that the proposed CG modeling can robustly and
             accurately reproduce the dynamic and structural properties of polymers

             learning potential for combined quantum mechanical/molecular
             mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of chemical reactions in the condensed
             phase. The new range correction enables short-ranged QM/MM
             interactions to be tuned for higher accuracy, and the correction
             smoothly vanishes within a specified cutoff. We further develop an
             active learning procedure for robust neural network training. We test
             the DPRc model and training procedure against a series of six
             nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer reactions in solution that are
             important in mechanistic studies of RNA-cleaving enzymes.
             Specifically, we apply DPRc corrections to a base QM model and test
             its ability to reproduce free-energy profiles generated from a target
             QM model. We perform these comparisons using the MNDO/d and DFTB2
             semiempirical models because they differ in the way they treat orbital
             orthogonalization and electrostatics and produce free-energy profiles
             which differ significantly from each other, thereby providing us a
             rigorous stress test for the DPRc model and training procedure. The
             comparisons show that accurate reproduction of the free-energy
             profiles requires correction of the QM/MM interactions out to 6
             {\r{A}}. We further find that the model's initial training benefits
             from generating data from temperature replica exchange simulations and
             including high-temperature configurations into the fitting procedure,
             so the resulting models are trained to properly avoid high-energy
             regions. A single DPRc model was trained to reproduce four different
             reactions and yielded good agreement with the free-energy profiles
             made from the target QM/MM simulations. The DPRc model was further
             demonstrated to be transferable to 2D free-energy surfaces and 1D
             free-energy profiles that were not explicitly considered in the
             training. Examination of the computational performance of the DPRc
             model showed that it was fairly slow when run on CPUs but was sped up
             almost 100-fold when using NVIDIA V100 GPUs, resulting in almost
             negligible overhead. The new DPRc model and training procedure provide
             a potentially powerful new tool for the creation of next-generation
             QM/MM potentials for a wide spectrum of free-energy applications
             ranging from drug discovery to enzyme design.},

             trained to accurately reproduce the statistical properties of the ab
             initio molecular dynamics. The second type does not require high
             accuracy, and a classical force field is used to describe it in an
             efficient way. The third type is used for a smooth transition between
             the first and the second types of regions. By using a force
             interpolation scheme and imposing a thermodynamics force in the
             transition region, we make the DeePMD region embedded in the AMM
             simulated system as if it were embedded in a system that is fully
             described by the accurate potential. A representative example of the
             liquid water system is used to show the feasibility and promise of
             this method.},

             potential to two- and/or three-body contributions. The scheme, called
             the Deep Coarse-Grained Potential (abbreviated DeePCG), exploits a
             carefully crafted neural network to construct a many-body coarse-
             grained potential. The network is trained with full atomistic data in
             a way that preserves the natural symmetries of the system. The
             resulting model is very accurate and can be used to sample the
             configurations of the coarse-grained variables in a much faster way
             than with the original atomistic model. As an application, we consider
             liquid water and use the oxygen coordinates as the coarse-grained
             variables, starting from a full atomistic simulation of this system at
             the ab initio molecular dynamics level. We find that the two-body,
             three-body, and higher-order oxygen correlation functions produced by
             the coarse-grained and full atomistic models agree very well with each

             fractionation with a conjugate caps method combined with neural
             networks (NN-GMFCC) is developed for efficient QM calculation of
             protein energy. In the NN-GMFCC scheme, the total energy of a given

             overlapping conjugate caps. In addition, the two-body interaction
             energies of residue pairs are calculated by molecular mechanics (MM).
             With reference to the GMFCC/MM calculation at the
             {\ensuremath{\omega}}B97XD/6-31G* level, the overall mean unsigned
             errors of the energy deviations and atomic force root-mean-squared

             particle swarm optimization algorithm or genetic algorithm, is needed
             to conduct crystal structure prediction. In recent years, machine
             learning-based interatomic potential energy surface models have been

             prediction for systems with the accuracy of density functional theory
             (DFT) and the speed of empirical force fields. In this paper, we
             employ a previously developed Deep Potential model to predict the
             intermetallic compound of the aluminum-magnesium system, and find six
             meta-stable phases with negative or nearly zero formation energy. In

             representing the interatomic potential energy surface allows us to
             achieve an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency in computer
             simulation of materials. A key point in developing such potentials is
             the preparation of a training dataset of ab initio trajectories. Here
             we apply a deep potential molecular dynamics (DeePMD) approach to
             develop NNP for silica, which is the representative glassformer widely
             used as a model system for simulating network-forming liquids and
             glasses. We show that the use of a relatively small training dataset
             of high-temperature ab initio configurations is enough to fabricate
             NNP, which describes well both structural and dynamical properties of
             liquid silica. In particular, we calculate the pair correlation
             functions, angular distribution function, velocity autocorrelation
             functions, vibrational density of states, and mean-square displacement
             and reveal a close agreement with ab initio data. We show that NNP
             allows us to expand significantly the time-space scales achievable in
             simulations and thus calculating dynamical and transport properties
             with more accuracy than that for ab initio methods. We find that
             developed NNP allows us to describe the structure of the glassy silica
             with satisfactory accuracy even though no low-temperature

             and a corresponding liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in supercooled
             liquid water remains a topic of much debate. An LLT has been
             rigorously proved in three empirically parametrized molecular models
             of water, and evidence consistent with an LLT has been reported for
             several other such models. In contrast, experimental proof of this
             phenomenon has been elusive due to rapid ice nucleation under deeply
             supercooled conditions. In this work, we combined density functional
             theory (DFT), machine learning, and molecular simulations to shed
             additional light on the possible existence of an LLT in water. We
             trained a deep neural network (DNN) model to represent the ab initio
             potential energy surface of water from DFT calculations using the
             Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functional. We
             then used advanced sampling simulations in the multithermal-multibaric
             ensemble to efficiently explore the thermophysical properties of the
             DNN model. The simulation results are consistent with the existence of
             an LLCP, although they do not constitute a rigorous proof thereof. We
             fit the simulation data to a two-state equation of state to provide an
             estimate of the LLCP's location. These combined results-obtained from
             a purely first-principles approach with no empirical parameters-are
             strongly suggestive of the existence of an LLT, bolstering the
             hypothesis that water can separate into two distinct liquid forms.},

             Conventional theories for interfacial thermal transport were derived
             based on bulk phonon properties of the materials making up the
             interface without explicitly considering the atomistic interfacial
             details, which are found critical to correctly describing thermal
             boundary conductance. Recent theoretical studies predicted the
             existence of localized phonon modes at the interface which can play an
             important role in understanding interfacial thermal transport.
             However, experimental validation is still lacking. Through a
             combination of Raman spectroscopy and high-energy-resolution electron
             energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron
             microscope, we report the experimental observation of localized
             interfacial phonon modes at ~12{\,}THz at a high-quality epitaxial Si-
             Ge interface. These modes are further confirmed using molecular
             dynamics simulations with a high-fidelity neural network interatomic
             potential, which also yield thermal boundary conductance agreeing well
             with that measured in time-domain thermoreflectance experiments.
             Simulations find that the interfacial phonon modes have an obvious
             contribution to the total thermal boundary conductance. Our findings
             significantly contribute to the understanding of interfacial thermal
             transport physics and have impact on engineering thermal boundary
             conductance at interfaces in applications such as electronics thermal
             management and thermoelectric energy conversion.},

             (aka the solvated "hydronium" cation) likely has two limiting forms,
             that of the Eigen cation (H9O4+) and that of the Zundel cation
             (H5O2+). There has been debate over which of these two is the more
             dominant species and/or whether intermediate (or "distorted")
             structures between these two limits are the more realistic
             representation. Spectroscopy experiments have recently provided
             further results regarding the excess proton. These experiments show
             that the hydrated proton has an anisotropy reorientation time scale on
             the order of 1-2 ps. This time scale has been suggested to possibly
             contradict the picture of the more rapid "special pair dance"
             phenomenon for the hydrated excess proton, which is a signature of a
             distorted Eigen cation. The special pair dance was predicted from
             prior computational studies in which the hydrated central core
             hydronium structure continually switches
             (O-H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}O)*
             special pair hydrogen-bond partners with the closest three water
             molecules, yielding on average a distorted Eigen cation with three
             equivalent and dynamically exchanging distortions. Through state-of-
             art simulations it is shown here that anisotropy reorientation time

             The new method is validated by comparing the DNN moments with those

             the electrostatic potential at the center of a molecular-sized

             theory, we consider how to train an artificial neural network
             potential to describe inhomogeneous, disordered systems. We find that
             neural network potentials based on local representations of atomic
             environments are capable of describing some properties of liquid-vapor
             interfaces but typically fail for properties that depend on unbalanced
             long-ranged interactions that build up in the presence of broken
             translation symmetry. These same interactions cancel in the
             translationally invariant bulk, allowing local neural network
             potentials to describe bulk properties correctly. By incorporating
             explicit models of the slowly varying long-ranged interactions and
             training neural networks only on the short-ranged components, we can
             arrive at potentials that robustly recover interfacial properties. We
             find that local neural network models can sometimes approximate a
             local molecular field potential to correct for the truncated
             interactions, but this behavior is variable and hard to learn.
             Generally, we find that models with explicit electrostatics are easier
             to train and have higher accuracy. We demonstrate this perspective in
             a simple model of an asymmetric dipolar fluid, where the exact long-
             ranged interaction is known, and in an ab initio water model, where it

             ability to provide good predictions of water properties by employing a
             strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functional has
             been extensively demonstrated in recent years. Here, we further
             advance the modeling of water by building a more accurate model on the
             fourth rung of Jacob's ladder with the hybrid functional, SCAN0. In
             particular, we carry out both classical and Feynman path-integral
             molecular dynamics calculations of water with the SCAN0 functional and
             the isobaric-isothermal ensemble. To generate the equilibrated
             structure of water, a deep neural network potential is trained from
             the atomic potential energy surface based on ab initio data obtained
             from SCAN0 DFT calculations. For the electronic properties of water, a
             separate deep neural network potential is trained by using the Deep
             Wannier method based on the maximally localized Wannier functions of
             the equilibrated trajectory at the SCAN0 level. The structural,
             dynamic, and electric properties of water were analyzed. The hydrogen-
             bond structures, density, infrared spectra, diffusion coefficients,
             and dielectric constants of water, in the electronic ground state, are
             computed by using a large simulation box and long simulation time. For
             the properties involving electronic excitations, we apply the GW
             approximation within many-body perturbation theory to calculate the
             quasiparticle density of states and bandgap of water. Compared to the
             SCAN functional, mixing exact exchange mitigates the self-interaction
             error in the meta-generalized-gradient approximation and further
             softens liquid water toward the experimental direction. For most of
             the water properties, the SCAN0 functional shows a systematic
             improvement over the SCAN functional. However, some important
             discrepancies remain. The H-bond network predicted by the SCAN0
             functional is still slightly overstructured compared to the
             experimental results.},

             fully understand and reproduce its complex phase diagram, it is
             necessary to perform simulations at the ab initio level, including
             quantum mechanical effects both for electrons and nuclei. This comes
             at a high computational cost, given that the structural and dynamical
             properties tend to require long timescales and large simulation cells.
             In this work, we evaluate the errors that density functional theory
             (DFT)-based simulations routinely incur into due time- and size-scale
             limitations. These errors are evaluated using neural-network-trained
             force fields that are accurate at the level of DFT methods. We compare

             water that require large timescales. We show that structural

We extracted datasets from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations and used these to train and validate the DPs. Large-scale and long-time molecular dynamics simulations were performed over a wider range of temperatures than AIMD to confirm the reliability and generality of the DPs. We demonstrated that the generated DPs can serve as a powerful tool for simulating alkali chlorides; the DPs also provide results with accuracy that is comparable to that of AIMD and efficiency that is similar to that of empirical potentials. The partial radial distribution functions and angle distribution functions predicted using the DPs are in close agreement with those derived from AIMD. The estimated densities, self-diffusion coefficients, shear viscosities, and electrical conductivities also matched well with the AIMD and experimental data. This work provides confidence that DPs can be used to explore other systems, including mixtures of chlorides or entirely different salts.}

Firstly, a deep learning potential for Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta-B diboride system was fitted with its prediction error in energy and force respectively being 9.2 meV/atom and 208 meV/Å, in comparison with first-principles calculations. Then, temperature dependent lattice constants, anisotropic thermal expansions, anisotropic phonon thermal conductivities, and elastic properties of high entropy (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)B2 from 0 °C to 2400 °C were evaluated, where the predicted room temperature values agree well with experimental measurements. In addition, intrinsic lattice distortions of (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)B2 were analyzed by displacements of atoms from their ideal positions, which are in an order of 10-3 Å and one order of magnitude smaller than those in (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)C. It indicates that lattice distortions in (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)B2 is not so severe as expected.

             initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). However,
             neither large-scale nor long-time calculations are feasible in the
             framework of the ab initio method, which makes it challenging to
             accurately predict some properties. To address this issue, a scheme
             based on ab initio calculation, deep neural networks, and machine
             learning is introduced. By training on high-quality data sets
             generated by ab initio calculations, a deep potential (DP) is
             constructed to describe the interaction between atoms. This work shows
             that the DP enables higher efficiency and similar accuracy relative to
             DFT. By performing molecular dynamics simulations with DP, the
             microstructure and thermophysical properties of the MgCl2-KCl eutectic
             (32:68 mol %) are investigated. The structural evolution with
             temperature is analyzed through partial radial distribution functions,
             coordination numbers, angular distribution functions, and structural
             factors. Meanwhile, the estimated thermophysical properties are
             discussed, including density, thermal expansion coefficient, shear
             viscosity, self-diffusion coefficient, and specific heat capacity. It
             reveals that the Mg2+ ions in this system have a distorted tetrahedral
             geometry rather than an octahedral one (with vacancies). The
             microstructure of the MgCl2-KCl eutectic shows the feature of medium-
             range order, and this feature will be enhanced at a higher
             temperature. All predicted thermophysical properties are in good
             agreement with the experimental results. The hydrodynamic radius
             determined from the shear viscosity and self-diffusion coefficient
             shows that the Mg2+ ions have a strong local structure and diffuse as
             if with an intact coordination shell. Overall, this work provides a
             thorough understanding of the microstructure and enriches the data of
             the thermophysical properties of the MgCl2-KCl eutectic.},

             management in any realistic device, the microscopic mechanisms of heat
             transport in all-solid-state electrolytes are poorly known: existing
             calculations, all based on simplistic semi-empirical models, are
             unreliable for superionic conductors and largely overestimate their
             thermal conductivity. In this work, we deploy a combination of state-
             of-the-art methods to calculate the thermal conductivity of a
             prototypical Li-ion conductor, the Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>ClO
             antiperovskite. By leveraging ab initio, machine learning, and force-
             field descriptions of interatomic forces, we are able to reveal the
             massive role of anharmonic interactions and diffusive defects on the
             thermal conductivity and its temperature dependence, and to eventually
             embed their effects into a simple rationale which is likely applicable
             to a wide class of ionic conductors.</jats:p>},

    abstract = {Ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) exhibit a unique combination of excellent properties, including ultra-high melting point, excellent chemical stability, and good oxidation resistance, which make them promising candidates for aerospace and nuclear applications. However, the degradation of high-temperature strength is one of the main limitations for their ultra-high temperature applications. Thus, searching for mechanisms that can help to develop high-performance UHTCs with good high-temperature mechanical properties is urgently needed. To achieve this goal, grain boundary segregation of a series of carbides, including conventional, medium entropy, and high entropy transition metal carbides, i.e., Zr0.95W0.05C, TiZrHfC3, ZrHfNbTaC4, TiZrHfNbTaC5, were studied by atomistic simulations with a fitted Deep Potential (DP), and the effects of segregation on grain boundary strength were emphasized. For all the studied carbides, grain boundary segregations are realized, which are dominated by the atomic size effect. In addition, tensile simulations indicate that grain boundaries (GBs) will usually be strengthened due to segregation. Our simulation results reveal that grain boundary segregation may be a universal mechanism in enhancing the high-temperature strength of both conventional UHTCs and medium/high entropy UHTCs, since GBs play a key role in controlling the fracture of UHTCs at elevated temperatures.}

             theory possible at a cost only moderately higher than that of
             empirical force fields. However, the majority of these models lack
             explicit long-range interactions and fail to describe properties that
             derive from the Coulombic tail of the forces. To overcome this
             limitation, we extend the DP model by approximating the long-range
             electrostatic interaction between ions (nuclei + core electrons) and
             valence electrons with that of distributions of spherical Gaussian
             charges located at ionic and electronic sites. The latter are
             rigorously defined in terms of the centers of the maximally localized
             Wannier distributions, whose dependence on the local atomic
             environment is modeled accurately by a deep neural network. In the DP
             long-range (DPLR) model, the electrostatic energy of the Gaussian
             charge system is added to short-range interactions that are
             represented as in the standard DP model. The resulting potential
             energy surface is smooth and possesses analytical forces and virial.
             Missing effects in the standard DP scheme are recovered, improving on
             accuracy and predictive power. By including long-range electrostatics,
             DPLR correctly extrapolates to large systems the potential energy
             surface learned from quantum mechanical calculations on smaller
             systems. We illustrate the approach with three examples: the potential
             energy profile of the water dimer, the free energy of interaction of a
             water molecule with a liquid water slab, and the phonon dispersion

             four-phonon scattering and diffusion transport in two-dimensional (2D)
             thermoelectric materials using the paraelectric phase of 2D SnSe as an
             example. The inherent soft phonon modes are treated by the self-
             consistent phonon theory, which considers the temperature-induced
             renormalization of the phonons. Based on density functional theory and
             the Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation for phonons, we show that the
             four-phonon interactions can reduce the thermal conductivity of the 2D
             SnSe sheet by nearly 40% due to the collapse of soft optical modes,
             and the contribution of diffusion transport to the total thermal
             conductivity accounts for 14% at a high temperature of 800 K due to
             the short phonon mean free path approaching the Ioffe-Regel limit,

             understanding the physical process of protein folding, with important
             implications for protein design and drug discovery. Molecular dynamics
             simulation strongly requires advanced force fields with high accuracy
             to achieve correct folding. However, the current force fields are
             inaccurate, inapplicable and inefficient. We propose a machine
             learning protocol, the inductive transfer learning force field
             (ITLFF), to construct protein force fields in seconds with any level
             of accuracy from a small dataset. This process is achieved by
             incorporating an inductive transfer learning algorithm into deep
             neural networks, which learn knowledge of any high-level calculations
             from a large dataset of low-level method. Here, we use a double-hybrid
             density functional theory (DFT) as a case functional, but ITLFF is
             suitable for any high-precision functional. The performance of the
             selected 18 proteins indicates that compared with the fragment-based
             double-hybrid DFT algorithm, the force field constructed by ITLFF
             achieves considerable accuracy with a mean absolute error of
             0.0039{~}kcal/mol/atom for energy and a root mean square error of
             2.57{~}$\mathrm{kcal}/\mathrm{mol}/{\AA}$ for force, and it is more
             than 30{~}000 times faster and obtains more significant efficiency
             benefits as the system increases. The outstanding performance of ITLFF
             provides promising prospects for accurate and efficient protein
             dynamic simulations and makes an important step toward protein folding
             simulation. Due to the ability of ITLFF to utilize the knowledge
             acquired in one task to solve related problems, it is also applicable

             nanostructured Ag{-}Au, such as Ag{-}Au
             nanoparticles and nanopillars, has been under intense investigation.
             To achieve high accuracy in molecular simulations of Ag{-}Au
             nanoalloys, the surface properties must be modeled with first-
             principles precision. In this work, we constructed a generalizable
             machine learning interatomic potential for Ag{-}Au
             nanoalloys based on deep neural networks trained from a database
             constructed with first-principles calculations. This potential is
             highlighted by the accurate prediction of Au (111) surface
             reconstruction and the segregation of Au toward the Ag{-}Au
             nanoalloy surface, where the empirical force field (EFF) failed in
             both cases. Moreover, regarding the adsorption and diffusion of
             adatoms on surfaces, the overall performance of our potential is
             better than the EFFs. We stress that the reported surface properties
             are blind to the potential modeling in the sense that none of the
             surface configurations is explicitly included in the training
             database; therefore, the reported potential is expected to have a
             strong generalization ability to a wide range of properties and to
             play a key role in investigating nanostructured Ag{-}Au

             and high photoelectric efficiencies. However, the structural
             instability originating from inherent ionic defects leads to a sharp
             drop in the photoelectric efficiency, which significantly limits their
             applications in solar cells. The instability induced by ionic defects
             remains unresolved due to its complicated reaction process. Herein, to
             explore the effects of ionic defects on stability, we develop a deep
             learning potential for a CsPbI3 ternary system based upon density
             functional theory (DFT) calculated data for large-scale molecular
             dynamics (MD) simulations. By exploring 2.4 million configurations, of
             which 7,730 structures are used for the training set, the deep
             learning potential shows an accuracy approaching DFT-level.
             Furthermore, MD simulations with a 5,000-atom system and a one
             nanosecond timeframe are performed to explore the effects of bulk and
             surface defects on the stability of CsPbI3 . This deep learning
             potential based MD simulation provides solid evidence together with
             the derived radial distribution functions, simulated diffraction of
             X-rays, instability temperature, molecular trajectory, and
             coordination number for revealing the instability mechanism of CsPbI3
             . Among bulk defects, Cs defects have the most significant influence
             on the stability of CsPbI3 with a defect tolerance concentration of
             0.32{\,}%, followed by Pb and I defects. With regards to surface
             defects, Cs defects have the largest impact on the stability of CsPbI3
             when the defect concentration is less than 15{\,}%, whereas Pb defects
             act play a dominant role for defect concentrations exceeding 20{\,}%.
             Most importantly, this machine-learning-based MD simulation strategy
             provides a new avenue to explore the ionic defect effects on the
             stability of perovskite-like materials, laying a theoretical
             foundation for the design of stable perovskite materials.},

             still debated. Based on density functional theory, we employ machine

             chloride, and sodium bromide solutions at different concentrations.
             The resulting reciprocal-space structure factors agree quantitatively

             ions in salt water do not distort the structure of water in the same
             way as neat water responds to elevated pressure. Rather, the computed

             accurate ab initio computational techniques preclude their application
             to modeling surface processes occurring on a long time scale, such as
             ALD. Although the situation can be greatly improved using machine

             atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) can be a challenging task if the
             flexibility of the adsorbent needs to be included. This is because
             potentials need to be developed that accurately account for the motion
             of the adsorbent in response to the presence of adsorbate molecules.
             In this work, we show that it is possible to use accurate machine
             learning atomistic potentials for metal-organic frameworks in concert
             with classical potentials for adsorbates to accurately compute
             diffusivities though a hybrid potential approach. As a proof-of-
             concept, we have developed an accurate deep learning potential (DP)
             for UiO-66, a metal-organic framework, and used this DP to perform
             hybrid potential simulations, modeling diffusion of neon and xenon
             through the crystal. The adsorbate-adsorbate interactions were modeled
             with Lennard-Jones (LJ) potentials, the adsorbent-adsorbent
             interactions were described by the DP, and the adsorbent-adsorbate
             interactions used LJ cross-interactions. Thus, our hybrid potential
             allows for adsorbent-adsorbate interactions with classical potentials
             but models the response of the adsorbent to the presence of the
             adsorbate through near-DFT accuracy DPs. This hybrid approach does not
             require refitting the DP for new adsorbates. We calculated self-
             diffusion coefficients for Ne in UiO-66 from DFT-MD, our hybrid DP/LJ
             approach, and from two different classical potentials for UiO-66. Our
             DP/LJ results are in excellent agreement with DFT-MD. We modeled
             diffusion of Xe in UiO-66 with DP/LJ and a classical potential.
             Diffusion of Xe in UiO-66 is about a factor of 30 slower than that of
             Ne, so it is not computationally feasible to compute Xe diffusion with
             DFT-MD. Our hybrid DP-classical potential approach can be applied to
             other MOFs and other adsorbates, making it possible to use an accurate
             DP generated from DFT simulations of an empty adsorbent in concert
             with existing classical potentials for adsorbates to model adsorption
             and diffusion within the porous material, including adsorbate-induced
             changes to the framework.},

             hundreds of target quantities calculated by first-principles
             approaches. To validate the reliability of the model, a convergence
             test of the cross-validation (CV) score to the training set size is
             commonly conducted to verify the sufficiency of the training data.
             However, such a test only confirms the convergence of the predictive
             capability of the CE model within the training set, and it is unknown
             whether the convergence of the CV score would lead to robust
             thermodynamic simulation results such as order-disorder phase
             transition temperature Tc. In this work, using carbon defective MoC1-x
             as a model system and aided by the machine-learning force field

             still leads to a significant uncertainty in the predicted Tc and that
             the latter can be considerably reduced by enlarging the training set
             to that of a few thousand configurations. This work highlights the
             importance of using a large training set to build the optimal CE model
             that can achieve robust statistical modeling results and the facility

             such that the cluster has equal probabilities of growing or melting at
             the given supersaturation), which is used together with the equations

             ab initio DFT (PBE0/6-31G*) QM/MM energies and forces. The DPRc thus
             enables both QM and QM/MM interactions to be tuned to high accuracy,

             Carlo, etc., generating a sufficient amount of data for training an ML
             potential has remained computationally challenging due to their high
             cost. In this work, we demonstrate that this issue can be largely
             alleviated with Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS), an ML-based DFT model. DeePKS
             employs a computationally efficient neural network-based functional
             model to construct a correction term added upon a cheap DFT model.
             Upon training, DeePKS offers closely matched energies and forces
             compared with high-level QM method, but the number of training data
             required is orders of magnitude less than that required for training a
             reliable ML potential. As such, DeePKS can serve as a bridge between
             expensive QM models and ML potentials: one can generate a decent
             amount of high-accuracy QM data to train a DeePKS model and then use

             method for estimating the free energy surface of an expensive "high-
             level" potential energy function from the umbrella sampling performed
             with multiple inexpensive "low-level" reference potentials. The gwTP
             method is a generalization of the weighted thermodynamic perturbation
             (wTP) method developed by Li and co-workers [J. Chem. Theory Comput.
             2018, 14, 5583-5596] that uses a single "low-level" reference
             potential. The gwTP method offers new possibilities in model design
             whereby the sampling generated from several low-level potentials may
             be combined (e.g., specific reaction parameter models that might have
             variable accuracy at different stages of a multistep reaction). The
             gwTP method is especially well suited for use with machine learning
             potentials (MLPs) that are trained against computationally expensive
             ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) energies and
             forces using active learning procedures that naturally produce
             multiple distinct neural network potentials. Simulations can be
             performed with greater sampling using the fast MLPs and then corrected
             to the ab initio level using gwTP. The capabilities of the gwTP method
             are demonstrated by creating reference potentials based on the MNDO/d
             and DFTB2/MIO semiempirical models supplemented with the "range-
             corrected deep potential" (DPRc). The DPRc parameters are trained to
             ab initio QM/MM data, and the potentials are used to calculate the
             free energy surface of stepwise mechanisms for nonenzymatic RNA
             2'-O-transesterification model reactions. The extended sampling made
             possible by the reference potentials allows one to identify
             unequilibrated portions of the simulations that are not always evident
             from the short time scale commonly used with ab initio QM/MM
             potentials. We show that the reference potential approach can yield
             more accurate ab initio free energy predictions than the wTP method or
             what can be reasonably afforded from explicit ab initio QM/MM
             sampling.},

             attention has been given to their mechanical properties, even though
             plastic deformation processes in the interiors of planets are known to

             ideal shear strength (ISS) and dislocation behavior. The ISS results
             are well described by the renormalized Frenkel model of ideal strength
             and indicate that the SI ices are expected to be highly ductile. This
             is further supported by deep neural network molecular dynamics
             simulations for the behavior of lattice dislocations for the SI face-

             transport being dominant. In contrast, in a spectrally mismatched

             the influence of the slab thickness on water dissociation energy
             (Ediss) at 1 monolayer coverage using static density functional theory
             calculation and found that Ediss exhibits odd-even oscillation with
             respect to the TiO2 slab thickness. However, less studies have
             accounted for the full solvation of an aqueous phase using ab initio
             molecular dynamics due to high computational costs in which only
             three, four, and five trilayer models of rutile(110)-water interfaces
             have been simulated. Here, we report Machine Learning accelerated
             Molecular Dynamics (MLMD) simulations of defect-free rutile(110)-water
             interfaces, which allows for a systematic study of the slab thickness
             ranging from 3 to 17 trilayers with much lower costs while keeping ab
             initio accuracy. Our MLMD simulations show that the dissociation
             degree of surface water ({\ensuremath{\alpha}}) oscillates with the
             slab thickness and converges to {\ensuremath{\sim}}2% as the TiO2 slab
             becomes thicker. Converting {\ensuremath{\alpha}} into dissociation
             free energy ({\ensuremath{\Delta}}Adiss) and comparing with
             dissociation total energy Ediss calculated with a single monolayer of
             water, we find that the full solvation of the interfaces suppresses
             surface water from dissociating. It is interesting to note that the
             machine learning potential trained from the dataset containing
             exclusively the five trilayer TiO2 model exhibits excellent
             transferability to other slab thicknesses and further captures the
             oscillating behavior of surface water dissociation. Detailed analyses

             interaction between double trilayers and, thus, the bonding strength
             between terminal Ti and water, which affects pKa of surface water and

             field. We trained a machine learning force field with high accuracy to
             explore this reconstruction. Our study shows that the lattice
             deformation in Au deeper layers, which allows the effective relaxation
             of the densified and anisotropic top layer lattice, is critical for
             the herringbone reconstruction. The herringbone reconstruction is

             evolution of the geometric and electronic structure of a CsPbBr3 GB on

             structural oscillations dynamically produce midgap trap states through
             Pb-Pb interactions across the GB. After several hundred picoseconds,
             structural distortions start to occur, increasing the occurrence of

             understanding their roles in biological and chemical processes but
             have not been fully explored. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is
             an important tool to address this issue, but two challenges exist.
             First, an accurate description of OH- from AIMD needs an appropriate
             exchange-correlation functional. Second, a long trajectory is needed
             to reach an equilibrium state for the Ca2+-OH- and Mg2+-OH- ion pairs
             in aqueous solutions. Herein, we adopt a deep potential molecular
             dynamics (DPMD) method to simulate 1 ns trajectories for the Ca2+-OH-
             and Mg2+-OH- ion pairs in water; the DPMD method provides efficient
             machine-learning-based models that have the accuracy of the SCAN
             exchange-correlation functional within the framework of density
             functional theory. The solvation structures of the cations and the OH-
             in terms of three different species have been systematically
             investigated. On the one hand, we find that OH- have more significant
             effects on the solvation structure of Ca2+ than that of Mg2+. We
             observe that the OH- substantially affects the orientation angles of
             water molecules surrounding the cation. Through the time correlation
             functions, we conclude that the water molecules in the first solvation
             shell of Ca2+ change their preferred orientation faster than those of
             Mg2+. On the other hand, with the presence of the cation in the first
             solvation shell of OH-, we find that the hydrogen bonds of OH- are
             severely altered, and the adjacent water molecules of OH- are
             squeezed. The two cations have substantially different effects on the
             solvation structure of OH-. Our work provides new insight into the

             significantly the probability of deep charge traps. However, the deep
             traps form only transiently for a few hundred femtoseconds. In
             contrast, shallow traps appear continuously at the GB. Shallow traps
             are localized in the GB layer, while deep traps are in a sublayer,
             which is still distorted from the pristine structure and can be jammed
             in unfavorable conformations. The GB electronic properties correlate
             with bond angles, with notable exception of the Br-Br distance, which
             provides a signature of halide migration along GBs. The transient

             complex, multiscale evolution of geometric and electronic structures

             Understanding aerosol nucleation dynamics is hindered by the
             nonreactivity of force fields (FFs) and high computational costs due
             to the rare event nature of aerosol nucleation. Developing reactive

             heterostructures formed by vertical stacking of monolayers GeS and SnS
             have been investigated systematically based on machine learning
             interatomic potential. The effect of van der Waals interface on the
             lattice thermal transport of 2D SnS and GeS can be well clarified by
             introducing various stacking configurations. Our results indicate that
             the van der Waals interface can strongly suppress the thermal
             transport capacity for the considered heterostructures, and either the
             average thermal conductivity per layer or the 2D thermal sheet
             conductance for the considered heterostructures is lower than that of
             corresponding monolayers. The suppressed thermal conductivity with
             tunable in-plane anisotropy in SnS/GeS heterostructures can be
             ascribed to the enhanced interface anharmonic scattering, and thus
             exhibits obvious interface-dependent characteristics. Therefore, this
             work highlights that the van der Waals interface can be employed to
             effectively modulate thermal transport for the 2D puckered group-IV

             ice (ZZ-qBI) and branched-zigzag quasi-bilayer ice (bZZ-qBI). Unlike
             conventional bilayer ices, few inter-layer hydrogen bonds were

             proper understanding of thermal transport across the TiO2-H2O
             interface. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play an important role
             in characterizing complex systems' interfacial thermal transport
             properties. Nevertheless, due to the imprecision of empirical force
             field potentials, the interfacial thermal transport mechanism
             involving water dissociation remains to be determined. To cope with
             this, a deep potential (DP) model is formulated through the
             utilization of ab{~}initio datasets. This model successfully simulates
             interfacial thermal transport accompanied by water dissociation on the
             TiO2 surfaces. The trained DP achieves a total energy accuracy of
             {\ensuremath{\sim}}238.8{~}meV and a force accuracy of
             {\ensuremath{\sim}}197.05 meV/{\r{A}}. The DPMD simulations show that
             water dissociation induces the formation of hydrogen bonding networks
             and molecular bridges. Structural modifications further affect
             interfacial thermal transport. The interfacial thermal conductance
             estimated by DP is {\ensuremath{\sim}}8.54 {\texttimes} 109 W/m2{~}K,
             smaller than {\ensuremath{\sim}}13.17 {\texttimes} 109 W/m2{~}K by
             empirical potentials. The vibrational density of states (VDOS)
             quantifies the differences between the DP model and empirical
             potentials. Notably, the VDOS disparity between the adsorbed hydrogen
             atoms and normal hydrogen atoms demonstrates the influence of water
             dissociation on heat transfer processes. This work aims to understand
             the effect of water dissociation on thermal transport at the TiO2-H2O
             interface. The findings will provide valuable guidance for the thermal

             condition, defined as T/Tm (Tm: melting temperature of iron) above
             0.96, is significantly reduced by ~30%, while Poisson's ratio jumps to
             approximately 0.44. MLMD simulations at 230 to 330 GPa indicate that
             collective motion with fast diffusive atomic migration occurs in

             a-In2O3 structure closer to the experimental data in comparison with
             DFT-MD and classical MD simulations with an analytical force field.
             Using the relatively large models obtained by the MLP-MD simulations,

             atoms attract electrons instead of the missing oxygen and remedy the
             optical transparency of the oxygen deficient a-In2O3. The preferential
             formation of metal{\textendash}H bonding through the reaction of
             oxygen vacancy was demonstrated as analogous to InGaZnOx thin films
             [Joonho et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 110, 232105 (2017)]. The present
             simulation suggests that the same mechanism works in a-In2O3, and our
             finding on the structure{\textendash}property relationship is
             informative to clarify the factors affecting the optical transparency
             of In-based TAOS thin films.</jats:p>},

             cores. Its structure and dynamics under high pressure and temperature
             is of great significance in studying geophysics and planetary science.
             However, for experimental techniques, it is still difficult to
             generate and probe such a state of matter under extreme conditions,
             while for theoretical method like molecular dynamics simulation, the
             reliable estimation of dynamic properties requires both large
             simulation size and &lt;i&gt;ab initio&lt;/i&gt; accuracy, resulting
             in unaffordable computational costs for traditional method. Owing to
             the technical limitation, the understanding of such matters remains
             limited. In this work, combining molecular dynamics simulation, we
             establish a neural network potential energy surface model to study the
             static and dynamic properties of liquid iron at its extreme
             thermodynamic state close to core-mantle boundary. The implementation
             of deep neural network extends the simulation scales from one hundred
             atoms to millions of atoms within quantum accuracy. The estimated
             static and dynamic structure factor show good consistency with all
             available X-ray diffraction and inelastic X-ray scattering
             experimental observations, while the empirical potential based on
             embedding-atom-method fails to give a unified description of liquid
             iron across a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. We also
             demonstrate that the transport property like diffusion coefficient
             exhibits a strong size effect, which requires more than at least ten
             thousands of atoms to give a converged value. Our results show that
             the combination of deep learning technology and molecular modelling

             examination of physical effects such as electron correlation,
             reciprocal space sampling, phonon anharmonicity, and nuclear quantum
             effects (NQE), among others. In this work, we attempt first-principles
             equation of state prediction for the crystalline materials ScF3 and
             CaZrF6, which are known to exhibit negative thermal expansion (NTE)
             over a broad temperature range. We develop neural network (NN)
             potentials for both ScF3 and CaZrF6 trained to extensive DFT data, and
             conduct direct molecular dynamics prediction of the equation(s) of

             softening phenomenon observed for ScF3 is not captured in our

             temperature but does not significantly contribute to equation of state
             predictions at increasing temperature. Overall, while the NN
             potentials are valuable for property prediction of these NTE (and
             related) materials, we infer that a higher level of electron
             correlation, beyond the generalized gradient approximation density

             pressures is of special interest but is also poorly understood because
             both experimental and conventional ab{~}initio methods are restricted
             to studying refractory covalent materials. The use of machine learning
             interatomic potentials is a revolutionary trend that gives a unique
             opportunity for high-temperature study of materials with ab{~}initio
             accuracy. We develop a deep machine learning potential (DP) for
             accurate atomistic simulations of the solid and liquid phases of BP as
             well as their transformations near the melting line. Our DP provides
             quantitative agreement with experimental and ab{~}initio molecular
             dynamics data for structural and dynamic properties. DP-based
             simulations reveal that at ambient pressure, a tetrahedrally bonded
             cubic BP crystal melts into an open structure consisting of two
             interpenetrating sub-networks of boron and phosphorous with different
             structures. Structure transformations of BP melt under compressing are
             reflected by the evolution of low-pressure tetrahedral coordination to
             high-pressure octahedral coordination. The main contributions to
             structural changes at low pressures are made by the evolution of
             medium-range order in the B-subnetwork and, at high pressures, by the
             change of short-range order in the P-subnetwork. Such transformations
             exhibit an anomalous behavior of structural characteristics in the
             range of 12-15{~}GPa. DP-based simulations reveal that the Tm(P) curve
             develops a maximum at P {\ensuremath{\approx}} 13 GPa, whereas
             experimental studies provide two separate branches of the melting
             curve, which demonstrate the opposite behavior. Analysis of the
             results obtained raises open issues in developing machine learning
             potentials for covalent materials and stimulates further experimental
             and theoretical studies of melting behavior in BP.},

             that the thermal conductivity is weakly dependent on temperature and

             pioneering work by Mishima and Stanley [Nature 392, 164-168 (1998)]
             sought to shed light on this problem by studying the melting curves of
             different ice polymorphs and their metastable continuation in the
             vicinity of the expected liquid-liquid transition and its associated
             critical point. Based on the continuous or discontinuous changes in
             the slope of the melting curves, Mishima [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 334
             (2000)] suggested that the liquid-liquid critical point lies between
             the melting curves of ice III and ice V. We explore this conjecture
             using molecular dynamics simulations with a machine learning model
             based on ab{~}initio quantum-mechanical calculations. We study the
             melting curves of ices III, IV, V, VI, and XIII and find that all of

             curves are supercritical is favored by the most recent computational
             and experimental evidence. Although the preponderance of evidence is
             consistent with the existence of a second critical point in water, the

             multiphase problem. Here, we realize the ab initio accuracy MD
             crystallization simulations of complex ceramics by using anisotropic
             collective variables (CVs) and machine learning (ML) potential. The
             anisotropic X-ray diffraction intensity CVs provide precise
             identification of complex crystal structures with detailed
             crystallography information, while the ML potential makes it feasible
             to further perform enhanced sampling simulations with ab initio
             accuracy. We verify the universality and accuracy of this method
             through complex ceramics with three kinds of representative
             structures, i.e., Ti3SiC2 for the MAX structure, zircon for the
             mineral structure, and lead zirconate titanate for the perovskite
             structure. It demonstrates exceptional efficiency and ab initio
             quality in achieving crystallization and generating free energy
             surfaces of all these ceramics, facilitating the analysis and design
             of complex crystalline materials.},

             local dynamic rearrangements or fluctuations occurring within them.
             Complex molecular systems, composed of many molecules interacting with
             each other in a Brownian storm, make no exception. Despite the rise of
             machine learning and of sophisticated structural descriptors,
             detecting local fluctuations and collective transitions in complex
             dynamic ensembles remains often difficult. Here, we show a machine
             learning framework based on a descriptor which we name Local
             Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), that allows identifying
             dynamic domains and detecting local fluctuations in a variety of
             systems in an abstract and efficient way. By tracking how much the
             microscopic surrounding of each molecular unit changes over time in
             terms of neighbor individuals, LENS allows characterizing the global
             (macroscopic) dynamics of molecular systems in phase transition,
             phases-coexistence, as well as intrinsically characterized by local
             fluctuations (e.g., defects). Statistical analysis of the LENS time
             series data extracted from molecular dynamics trajectories of, for
             example, liquid-like, solid-like, or dynamically diverse complex
             molecular systems allows tracking in an efficient way the presence of
             different dynamic domains and of local fluctuations emerging within
             them. The approach is found robust, versatile, and applicable
             independently of the features of the system and simply provided that a
             trajectory containing information on the relative motion of the
             interacting units is available. We envisage that "such a LENS" will
             constitute a precious basis for exploring the dynamic complexity of a
             variety of systems and, given its abstract definition, not necessarily
             of molecular ones.},

             little is known about the structures of the a-TiO2 surface and aqueous
             interface, particularly at the microscopic level. In this work, we
             construct a model of the a-TiO2 surface via a cut-melt-and-quench
             procedure based on molecular dynamics simulations with deep neural
             network potentials (DPs) trained on density functional theory data.
             After interfacing the a-TiO2 surface with water, we investigate the

             DP-based molecular dynamics (DPMD) and ab{~}initio molecular dynamics

             in chemical and biological systems and have been a hot research topic.
             Spectroscopic characterization and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
             simulations have previously revealed insights into acidic and basic
             liquids. Presumably, the situation in the acidic/basic solution is not
             necessarily the same as in pure water; in addition, the autoionization
             constant for water is only 10-14 under ambient conditions, making the
             study of PT in pure water challenging. To overcome this issue, we
             modeled periodic water box systems containing 1000 molecules for tens
             of nanoseconds based on a neural network potential (NNP) with quantum
             mechanical accuracy. The NNP was generated by training a dataset
             containing the energies and atomic forces of 17 075 configurations of
             periodic water box systems, and these data points were calculated at
             the MP2 level that considers electron correlation effects. We found
             that the size of the system and the duration of the simulation have a
             significant impact on the convergence of the results. With these
             factors considered, our simulations showed that hydronium (H3O+) and
             hydroxide (OH-) ions in water have distinct hydration structures,
             thermodynamic and kinetic properties, e.g., the longer-lasting and
             more stable hydrated structure of OH- ions than that of H3O+, as well
             as a significantly higher free energy barrier for the OH--associated
             PT than that of H3O+, leading the two to exhibit completely different
             PT behaviors. Given these characteristics, we further found that PT
             via OH- ions tends not to occur multiple times or between many
             molecules. In contrast, PT via H3O+ can synergistically occur among
             multiple molecules and prefers to adopt a cyclic pattern among three
             water molecules, while it occurs mostly in a chain pattern when more
             water molecules are involved. Therefore, our studies provide a
             detailed and solid microscopic explanation for the PT process in pure
             water.},

             screening existing and novel materials, sampling potential energy
             surfaces, and generating data for machine learning applications. By
             including a fraction of exact exchange (EXX), hybrid functionals
             reduce the self-interaction error in semilocal DFT and furnish a more
             accurate description of the underlying electronic structure, albeit at
             a computational cost that often prohibits such high-throughput
             applications. To address this challenge, we have constructed a robust,
             accurate, and computationally efficient framework for high-throughput
             condensed-phase hybrid DFT and implemented this approach in the PWSCF
             module of Quantum ESPRESSO (QE). The resulting SeA approach (SeA =
             SCDM + exx + ACE) combines and seamlessly integrates: (i) the selected
             columns of the density matrix method (SCDM, a robust noniterative
             orbital localization scheme that sidesteps system-dependent
             optimization protocols), (ii) a recently extended version of exx (a
             black-box linear-scaling EXX algorithm that exploits sparsity between
             localized orbitals in real space when evaluating the action of the
             standard/full-rank V^xx operator), and (iii) adaptively compressed
             exchange (ACE, a low-rank V^xx approximation). In doing so, SeA
             harnesses three levels of computational savings: pair selection and
             domain truncation from SCDM + exx (which only considers spatially
             overlapping orbitals on orbital-pair-specific and system-size-
             independent domains) and low-rank V^xx approximation from ACE (which
             reduces the number of calls to SCDM + exx during the self-consistent
             field (SCF) procedure). Across a diverse set of 200 nonequilibrium
             (H2O)64 configurations (with densities spanning 0.4-1.7 g/cm3), SeA
             provides a 1-2 order-of-magnitude speedup in the overall time-to-
             solution, i.e., {\ensuremath{\approx}}8-26{\texttimes} compared to the
             convolution-based PWSCF(ACE) implementation in QE and
             {\ensuremath{\approx}}78-247{\texttimes} compared to the conventional
             PWSCF(Full) approach, and yields energies, ionic forces, and other
             properties with high fidelity. As a proof-of-principle high-throughput
             application, we trained a deep neural network (DNN) potential for
             ambient liquid water at the hybrid DFT level using SeA via an actively
             learned data set with {\ensuremath{\approx}}8,700 (H2O)64
             configurations. Using an out-of-sample set of (H2O)512 configurations
             (at nonambient conditions), we confirmed the accuracy of this SeA-
             trained potential and showcased the capabilities of SeA by computing
             the ground-truth ionic forces in this challenging system containing

             infrared spectrum (IR) of confined water to existing experiments to
             elucidate confinement effects. For CNTs with diameters >1.2 nm, we
             find that confinement imposes a monotonic effect on the hydrogen-bond
             network and on the IR spectrum of water. In contrast, confinement
             below 1.2 nm CNT diameter affects the water structure in a complex
             fashion, leading to a strong directional dependence of hydrogen
             bonding that varies nonlinearly with the CNT diameter. When integrated
             with existing IR measurements, our simulations provide a new
             interpretation for the IR spectrum of water confined in CNTs, pointing
             to previously unreported aspects of hydrogen bonding in this system.
             This work also offers a general platform for simulating water in CNTs
             with quantum accuracy on time and length scales beyond the reach of
             conventional first-principles approaches.},

             ({\ensuremath{\beta}}-Ga2O3) fundamentally determines its interaction
             with an electromagnetic wave in bulk power. Yet, there is a lack of
             experimental data due to limitations of high-temperature MW dielectric
             measurements and the large uncertainty under variable-temperature
             conditions. Herein, we develop a deep potential (DP) based on density
             functional theory (DFT) results and apply deep potential molecular
             dynamics (DPMD) for accurately predicting temperature-dependent MW
             dielectric permittivity of {\ensuremath{\beta}}-Ga2O3. The predicted
             energies and forces by DP demonstrate excellent agreement with DFT
             results, and DPMD successfully simulates systems up to 1280 atoms with
             quantum precision over nanosecond scales. Overall, the real part of
             the MW dielectric permittivity decreases with rising frequency, but
             the dielectric loss increases. The MW dielectric permittivity
             gradually increases as the temperature increases, which is closely
             related to the reduced dielectric relaxation time and increased static
             and high-frequency dielectric constants. Besides, the oxygen vacancy
             defects significantly reduce the relaxation time; however, augmenting
             the defect concentration will cause a slight rise in relaxation time.
             The electron localization function analysis reveals that more free
             electrons and low localization of electrons produced by high defect
             concentrations facilitate the increased relaxation time. This study
             provides an alternative route to investigate the temperature-dependent
             MW permittivity of {\ensuremath{\beta}}-Ga2O3, which attains prime
             importance for its potential applications in RF and power

             This is the case, for example, of phase transitions, phase equilibria,
             nucleation events, and defect propagation, to mention a few. A
             detailed comprehension of local atomic environments and of their

             also to draw structure-property relationships useful to unveil how to
             control complex molecular systems. Considerable progress in the
             development of advanced structural descriptors [e.g., Smooth Overlap
             of Atomic Position (SOAP), etc.] has certainly enhanced the
             representation of atomic-scale simulations data. However, despite such

             data and of their time derivatives allows us to detect dynamic domains
             and track instantaneous changes of local atomic arrangements (i.e.,
             local fluctuations) in a variety of molecular systems. The approach is
             simple and general, and we expect that it will help shed light on a

             that graphanol (hydroxylated graphane) will conduct protons
             anhydrously with very low diffusion barriers. We developed a deep
             learning potential (DP) for graphanol that has near-density functional

             computational cost. We used our DP to calculate proton self-diffusion

             barrier to proton diffusion, and to characterize the impact of thermal
             fluctuations as a function of system size. We propose and test a

             We show that protons can rapidly hop along Grotthuss chains containing

             conduction of protons forward and backward along the chain without
             hydroxyl group rotation. Long-range proton transport only takes place
             as new Grotthuss chains are formed by rotation of one or more hydroxyl
             groups in the chain. Thus, the overall diffusion barrier consists of a
             convolution of the intrinsic proton hopping barrier and the intrinsic
             hydroxyl rotation barrier. Our results provide a set of design rules

             phase diagram in the liquid-vapor coexistence regime. The machine
             learning model is trained on ab{~}initio energies and forces based on
             the SCAN density functional, which has been previously shown to
             reproduce solid phases and other properties of water. Here, we compute
             the surface tension, saturation pressure, and enthalpy of vaporization
             for a range of temperatures spanning from 300 to 600{~}K and evaluate
             the Deep Potential model performance against experimental results and
             the semiempirical TIP4P/2005 classical model. Moreover, by employing
             the seeding technique, we evaluate the free energy barrier and
             nucleation rate at negative pressures for the isotherm of 296.4{~}K.
             We find that the nucleation rates obtained from the Deep Potential
             model deviate from those computed for the TIP4P/2005 water model due
             to an underestimation in the surface tension from the Deep Potential
             model. From analysis of the seeding simulations, we also evaluate the
             Tolman length for the Deep Potential water model, which is (0.091
             {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.008) nm at 296.4{~}K. Finally, we identify that
             water molecules display a preferential orientation in the liquid-vapor
             interface, in which H atoms tend to point toward the vapor phase to
             maximize the enthalpic gain of interfacial molecules. We find that
             this behavior is more pronounced for planar interfaces than for the
             curved interfaces in bubbles. This work represents the first
             application of Deep Potential models to the study of liquid-vapor
             coexistence and water cavitation.},

             from classical and path integral molecular dynamics umbrella sampling.
             The modified form of the Bigeleisen-Mayer equation consists of a ratio
             of imaginary mode vibrational frequencies and a contribution arising
             from the isotopic substitution's effect on the activation free energy,
             which can be computed from path integral simulation. In the present
             study, we describe a practical method for estimating the frequency
             ratio correction directly from umbrella sampling in a manner that does
             not require normal mode analysis of many geometry optimized
             structures. Instead, the method relates the frequency ratio to the
             change in the mass weighted coordinate representation of the minimum
             free energy path at the transition state induced by isotopic
             substitution. The method is applied to the calculation of 16/18O and
             32/34S primary kinetic isotope effect values for six non-enzymatic
             phosphoryl transfer reactions. We demonstrate that the results are
             consistent with the analysis of geometry optimized transition state
             ensembles using the traditional Bigeleisen-Mayer equation. The method
             thus presents a new practical tool to enable facile calculation of

             indium selenide (InSe), exhibit salient carrier transport properties
             and evince extensive interest for broad applications. A comprehensive
             understanding of thermal transport is indispensable for thermal
             management. However, theoretical predictions on thermal transport in
             the InSe system are found in disagreement with experimental
             measurements. In this work, we utilize both the Green-Kubo approach
             with deep potential (GK-DP), together with the phonon Boltzmann
             transport equation with density functional theory (BTE-DFT) to
             investigate the thermal conductivity ({\ensuremath{\kappa}}) of InSe
             monolayer. The {\ensuremath{\kappa}} calculated by GK-DP is 9.52 W/mK
             at 300 K, which is in good agreement with the experimental value,
             while the {\ensuremath{\kappa}} predicted by BTE-DFT is 13.08 W/mK.
             After analyzing the scattering phase space and cumulative
             {\ensuremath{\kappa}} by mode-decomposed method, we found that, due to
             the large energy gap between lower and upper optical branches, the
             exclusion of four-phonon scattering in BTE-DFT underestimates the
             scattering phase space of lower optical branches due to large group
             velocities, and thus would overestimate their contribution to
             {\ensuremath{\kappa}}. The temperature dependence of
             {\ensuremath{\kappa}} calculated by GK-DP also demonstrates the effect
             of higher-order phonon scattering, especially at high temperatures.
             Our results emphasize the significant role of four-phonon scattering
             in InSe monolayer, suggesting that combining molecular dynamics with
             machine learning potential is an accurate and efficient approach to
             predict thermal transport.},

             Evolution of the intermolecular energy and the Lindemann index are

             particle surface and further expands with increased temperature. Once

             most useful methods to create interatomic potentials. Among ceramic
             materials, amorphous silicon nitride (SiNx) features good electrical
             insulation, abrasion resistance, and mechanical strength, which is
             widely applied in industries. In our work, a neural network potential

             to be applicable to the SiNx model. The tensile tests were simulated
             to compare the mechanical properties of SiNx with different
             compositions based on the molecular dynamic method coupled with NNP.
             Among these SiNx, Si3N4 has the largest elastic modulus (E) and yield
             stress ({\ensuremath{\sigma}}s), showing the desired mechanical
             strength owing to the largest coordination numbers (CN) and radial

             increase of x; meanwhile, E and {\ensuremath{\sigma}}s of SiNx

             known that their atomic lattices may become dynamic and undergo
             reconfigurations even well below the melting temperature. The innate
             atomic dynamics of metals is directly related to their bulk and
             surface properties. Understanding their complex structural dynamics
             is, thus, important for many applications but is not easy. Here, we
             report deep-potential molecular dynamics simulations allowing to
             resolve at an atomic resolution the complex dynamics of various types
             of copper (Cu) surfaces, used as an example, near the H{\"u}ttig
             ({\ensuremath{\sim}}1/3 of melting) temperature. The development of
             deep neural network potential trained on density functional theory
             calculations provides a dynamically accurate force field that we use
             to simulate large atomistic models of different Cu surface types. A
             combination of high-dimensional structural descriptors and
             unsupervized machine learning allows identifying and tracking all the
             atomic environments (AEs) emerging in the surfaces at finite
             temperatures. We can directly observe how AEs that are non-native in a
             specific (ideal) surface, but that are, instead, typical of other
             surface types, continuously emerge/disappear in that surface in
             relevant regimes in dynamic equilibrium with the native ones. Our
             analyses allow estimating the lifetime of all the AEs populating these
             Cu surfaces and to reconstruct their dynamic interconversions
             networks. This reveals the elusive identity of these metal surfaces,
             which preserve their identity only in part and in part transform into
             something else under relevant conditions. This also proposes a concept
             of "statistical identity" for metal surfaces, which is key to
             understanding their behaviors and properties.},

             within the hundreds of thousands of MOF structures known today, it
             remains a challenge to computationally identify the best suited

             combining the computational efficiency of the DeePMD framework and the
             demonstrated accuracy of the MB-pol data-driven, many-body potential
             to train a DNN potential for large-scale simulations of water across
             its phase diagram. We find that the DNN potential is able to reliably
             reproduce the MB-pol results for liquid water, but provides a less
             accurate description of the vapor-liquid equilibrium properties. This
             shortcoming is traced back to the inability of the DNN potential to
             correctly represent many-body interactions. An attempt to explicitly
             include information about many-body effects results in a new DNN
             potential that exhibits the opposite performance, being able to
             correctly reproduce the MB-pol vapor-liquid equilibrium properties,
             but losing accuracy in the description of the liquid properties. These

             correctly "learn" and, consequently, represent many-body interactions,

             the properties for state points that are not explicitly included in
             the training process. The computational efficiency of the DeePMD
             framework can still be exploited to train DNN potentials on data-
             driven many-body potentials, which can thus enable large-scale,
             "chemically accurate" simulations of various molecular systems, with
             the caveat that the target state points must have been adequately
             sampled by the reference data-driven many-body potential in order to
             guarantee a faithful representation of the associated properties.},

             learning-based potential energy surface (ML-PES) provides a powerful

             quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations can be invoked to
             efficiently obtain locally accurate ML-PESs. We prove our concept with

             of using machine learning (ML) techniques to "derive" an implicit
             solvent model directly from explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD)
             simulations. For alanine dipeptide, a machine learning potential (MLP)
             based on the DeepPot-SE representation of the molecule was trained to
             capture its interactions with its average solvent environment
             configuration (ASEC). The predicted forces on the solute deviated only
             by an RMSD of 0.4 kcal mol-1 {\r{A}}-1 from the reference values, and
             the MLP-based free energy surface differed from that obtained from
             explicit solvent MD simulations by an RMSD of less than 0.9 kcal

             additional cost on top of the QM calculation of the solute.},

             dynamics simulations with ab{~}initio-based deep neural network
             potentials that accurately describe water/TiO2(110) interactions over
             a wide range of water coverages. Simulations on TiO2(110) slab models
             of increasing thickness provide insight into the dynamic equilibrium
             between molecular and dissociated adsorbed water at the interface and
             allow us to obtain a reliable estimate of the equilibrium fraction of
             water dissociation. We find a dissociation fraction of 22
             {\ensuremath{\pm}} 6% with an associated average hydroxyl lifetime of
             7.6 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.8 ns. These quantities are both much larger
             than corresponding estimates for the aqueous anatase TiO2(101)
             interface, consistent with the higher water photooxidation activity
             that is observed for rutile relative to anatase.},

             canonical ensemble condition with a constant potential and/or a
             constant pH value. Free energy profiles provide key insights into
             understanding the reaction mechanisms. However, many molecular
             dynamics (MD)-based theoretical studies for electrochemical reactions
             did not employ an exact grand canonical ensemble sampling scheme for
             the free energy calculations, partially due to the issues of
             discontinuous trajectories induced by the particle-number variations
             during MD simulations. An alternative statistical sampling approach,
             the Monte Carlo (MC) method, is naturally appropriate for the open-
             system simulations if we focus on the thermodynamic properties. An
             advanced MC scheme, the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method, which can
             efficiently sample the configurations of a system with large degrees
             of freedom, however, has limitations in the constrained-sampling
             applications. In this work, we propose an adjusted constrained HMC
             method to compute free energy profiles using the thermodynamic
             integration (TI) method. The key idea of the method for handling the
             constraint in TI is to integrate the reaction coordinate and sample
             the rest degrees of freedom by two types of MC schemes, the HMC scheme
             and the Metropolis algorithm with unbiased trials (M(RT)2-UB). We test
             the proposed method on three different systems involving two kinds of
             reaction coordinates, which are the distance between two particles and
             the difference of particles' distances, and compare the results to
             those generated by the constrained M(RT)2-UB method serving as
             benchmarks. We show that our proposed method has the advantages of
             high sampling efficiency and convenience of implementation, and the
             accuracy is justified as well. In addition, we show in the third test
             system that the proposed constrained HMC method can be combined with
             the path integral method to consider the nuclear quantum effects,
             indicating a broader application scenario of the sampling method

             model for the LaCl3-H2O system in hydrothermal fluids is developed

             properties, and plays a key role in the climate of our planet.
             Although ice can form directly from liquid water under deeply
             supercooled conditions, the presence of foreign particles can aid ice
             formation at much warmer temperatures. Over the past decade,
             experiments have highlighted the remarkable efficiency of feldspar
             minerals as ice nuclei compared to other particles present in the
             atmosphere. However, the exact mechanism of ice formation on feldspar
             surfaces has yet to be fully understood. Here, we develop a first-
             principles machine-learning model for the potential energy surface
             aimed at studying ice nucleation at microcline feldspar surfaces. The
             model is able to reproduce with high-fidelity the energies and forces
             derived from density-functional theory (DFT) based on the SCAN
             exchange and correlation functional. Our training set includes
             configurations of bulk supercooled water, hexagonal and cubic ice,
             microcline, and fully-hydroxylated feldspar surfaces exposed to a
             vacuum, liquid water, and ice. We apply the machine-learning force
             field to study different fully-hydroxylated terminations of the (100),
             (010), and (001) surfaces of microcline exposed to a vacuum. Our
             calculations suggest that terminations that do not minimize the number
             of broken bonds are preferred in a vacuum. We also study the structure
             of supercooled liquid water in contact with microcline surfaces, and
             find that water density correlations extend up to around 10 {\r{A}}
             from the surfaces. Finally, we show that the force field maintains a
             high accuracy during the simulation of ice formation at microcline
             surfaces, even for large systems of around 30{\,}000 atoms. Future
             work will be directed towards the calculation of nucleation free-
             energy barriers and rates using the force field developed herein, and
             understanding the role of different microcline surfaces in ice

             especially when the elements are randomly doped. In this work, a
             first-principles based deep neural network potential (NNP) is
             developed to investigate the lattice thermal transport properties of
             Cr-doped Sb2Te3 using molecular dynamics simulations. Compared with
             pure Sb2Te3, the thermal conductivity of orderly Cr-doped Sb2Te3 with
             Cr atoms locating at specific atomic layer positions decreases
             slightly in the in-plane direction, but sharply in the out-of-plane
             direction. The decrease of the low frequency phonon density of states
             and the enhancement of phonon scattering near 2.5 THz are the primary
             reasons for the decrease in the thermal conductivity of Cr-doped
             Sb2Te3, while the decrease of phonon velocity due to band flattening
             is the reason for the sharp decrease of thermal conductivity in the
             out-of-plane direction. Moreover, the thermal conductivities of
             randomly Cr-doped Sb2Te3 with different Cr concentrations are also
             investigated using the NNP. It is found that the thermal
             conductivities in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions are
             reduced by 76% and 80%, respectively, for Sb36Cr36Te108. Furthermore,
             the influence of different Cr dopant arrays on the thermal

             origin of the high ionic conductivity of the material at the atomic

             Li3OCl system, and the Li vacancy is the main carrier. The ionic
