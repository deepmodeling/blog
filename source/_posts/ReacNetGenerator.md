### Background

In recent years, **reactive molecular dynamics (Reactive MD)** simulation methods have been widely used to study the reaction mechanisms of various complex molecular systems, such as:
- **Combustion**
- **Explosions**
- **Heterogeneous catalysis**

However, long-term MD simulations of large systems generate highly complex trajectory files that include numerous reactions and molecular species. **Manually analyzing such trajectories is impractical.**

### About ReacNetGenerator

To address these challenges, the **ReacNetGenerator** software was introduced in the spring of 2018. 

#### Key Features:
- **Input Requirements:** Uses atomic coordinates from the trajectory as its sole input.
- **Automatic Analysis:** Determines species and reactions based on atomic connectivity.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Presents reaction types, quantities, and networks on an interactive webpage.
  - Users can click to analyze localized reaction networks involving specific species.
- **Noise Filtering:** Employs a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** to filter noise, highlighting key reactions.
- **High Efficiency:** Supports **parallel computing** and optimized memory usage, making it capable of analyzing large trajectory files.
