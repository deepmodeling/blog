Recently, the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation published a research work titled DeePMD - kit v3: A Multiple - Backend Framework for Machine Learning Potentials [1]. This work focuses on a core innovation in the DeePMD - kit v3 version - the multi - backend framework. The latest version has integrated four deep learning backends: TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, and PaddlePaddle.

The paper elaborates on the design concept and implementation details of the multi - backend framework. Different from other software that independently implements different backends in separate software packages, DeePMD - kit enables multiple backends to share a unified module through a clever structural design, significantly reducing development and maintenance costs. In addition, the paper compares the characteristics of different backends and introduces other important design details in the v3 version.

The paper also highlights two major advantages of the multi - backend framework. In terms of functionality, taking the DeePMD - GNN plugin [2] and the DMFF plugin as examples, the paper shows how the multi - backend architecture better supports the expansion of new functions dependent on specific backends. In terms of performance, the research team conducted comprehensive dynamic simulation performance tests on backends such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX. The results show that no single backend has an absolute advantage in all scenarios, allowing users to freely choose the most suitable backend according to specific needs to achieve optimal performance.
