In an era of increasing intersection between materials science and artificial intelligence, machine learning technologies are gradually becoming essential tools for materials research. To help students and researchers explore new approaches for materials design, discovery, and optimization from an artificial intelligence perspective using machine learning methods, Professor Shan Bin from Huazhong University of Science and Technology will offer the course *Material Big Data* and *Machine Learning* offline on May 12, 2025. As always, course content will be updated online simultaneously to facilitate online learning for interested learners worldwide.

Professor Shan Bin has made outstanding research achievements and possesses extensive teaching experience in the interdisciplinary field of materials science and machine learning. His *Computational Materials Science* course at Huazhong University of Science and Technology has been meticulously refined over more than a decade, with content presented in an accessible yet profound manner, making it a highly influential open course in the field of computational materials science. Since its launch on the Bohrium platform, the course has attracted over 7,000 learners. Additionally, the supporting course for Professor Shan Bin’s book *Computational Materials Science: From Algorithm Principles* to Code Implementation is also available on the Bohrium platform, covering additional details of the computational materials science curriculum.

## Why Take This Course?

Beyond its systematic and comprehensive content, the course maintains a **practice-oriented** teaching model. Professor Shan Bin emphasizes the importance of hands-on experience in mastering machine learning. Through Bohrium Notebook—a powerful practical tool—substantial hands-on coding sessions are integrated into the curriculum. Learners can run Notebooks online using CPU or GPU cores in the Bohrium environment, reproduce and practice course cases directly, and freely save, create, and share Notebook content to build personalized "learning portfolios." This approach deepens understanding of theoretical knowledge through practical application, ensuring learners master every detail from theory to implementation and truly integrate learning with practice.
