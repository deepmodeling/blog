Ferroelectric materials have important applications in the fields of non-volatile data storage, neuromorphic computing, and signal sensing due to their switchable spontaneous polarization properties under an applied electric field. Recently, research based on van der Waals layered materials has proposed a new ferroelectric mechanism that is completely different from traditional ionic ferroelectrics: sliding ferroelectricity, that is, ferroelectric polarization reversal is achieved through interlayer sliding. The team and experimental collaborators previously used Deep Potential to demonstrate that this non-intrinsic ferroelectricity can exhibit ultrafast polarization reversal mechanics and excellent anti-fatigue properties [Science 385, 57-62 (2025); Acta Mater. 262, 119416 (2024)].

Recently, the authors theoretically studied the dynamic properties of domain walls in sliding ferroelectric 3R-MoS₂ by combining Deep Potential and field theory analysis. The research results show that, unlike the strong damping of traditional ferroelectric domain wall motion, the domain wall motion in sliding ferroelectrics exhibits ultra-low damping characteristics, which is consistent with the ultra-slip characteristics of domain walls observed in h-BN sliding ferroelectrics by the team of Liu Shi from Westlake University [published in PRL 135, 046201 (2025) on the same day], jointly proving that ultra-low damping domain wall motion is universal in sliding ferroelectric materials. Due to the ultra-low damping property, the sliding ferroelectric domain wall shows uniformly accelerated motion under an external field, so the sliding ferroelectric domain wall is a free soliton that follows Newton's second law. In addition, calculations show that the velocity of the bilayer MoS₂ domain wall can reach a relativistic-like limit (4000 m/s) under continuous external field driving, which is the group velocity of the in-plane transverse acoustic branch. More importantly, after removing the external field, the sliding ferroelectric domain wall maintains uniform inertial motion, which is completely different from the motion stopping observed in traditional ferroelectrics. This work provides a theoretical basis for the application of sliding ferroelectric domain walls in microelectronic devices (such as racetrack memories and neuromorphic devices).
