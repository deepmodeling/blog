On the journey toward developing a Large Atomic Model (LAM), the core Deep Potential development team has launched the OpenLAM initiative for the community. OpenLAMâ€™s slogan is "Conquer the Periodic Table!" The project aims to create an open-source ecosystem centered on microscale large models, providing new infrastructure for microscopic scientific research and driving transformative advancements in microscale industrial design across fields such as materials, energy, and biopharmaceuticals.

## Codes
The code underwent a large-scale restructuring, and the DeePMD-kit v3 alpha version was successfully released in early March. Compared to v2, DeePMD-kit v3 allows users to train and run deep potential models on either the TensorFlow or PyTorch framework, facilitating broader compatibility across downstream applications. DeePMD-kit v3 also adds support for the DPA-2 model, marking a new chapter for Large Atomic Models (LAM). For a more detailed report, see: https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/discussions/3401.

The latest 2024 Q1 branch version of DeePMD-kit v3 (available at https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/tree/2024Q1) includes the following new features:

DeepSpin Upgrade: The PyTorch version now supports all descriptors, including DPA-2, and allows integration with model structures like type embedding, enabling the development of higher-precision magnetic models. This is particularly advantageous for studies involving magnetic systems. Example input: https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/blob/2024Q1/examples/spin/se_e2_a/input_torch.json.
Multitask Feature Upgrade: The PyTorch version now supports multitask fine-tuning, allowing users to fine-tune a pre-trained model on multiple downstream systems simultaneously. Documentation is available at: https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/blob/devel/doc/train/finetuning.md#multi-task-fine-tuning.

## Date
- A data-cleaning workflow was initially established (https://github.com/zjgemi/lam-data-cleaning), and 74 datasets selected from the ColabFit collection (https://materials.colabfit.org/) were incorporated into training. Tests indicate that the model achieved the expected accuracy in multitask training at a scale of 100 tasks.

- A new chalcogenide solid electrolyte dataset was added, covering 26 types of sulfides. Compared to other general-purpose force fields, the DPA-SSE model more accurately predicts dynamic properties such as the diffusion coefficient of Li ions and ionic conductivity.

- The MPtraj dataset was cleaned and categorized, and training and testing were conducted on the updated DPA-2 model structure. Initial results indicate an improvement in model performance.

## Models
The pre-trained model OpenLAM_2.1.0_27heads_20224Q1.pt, compatible with the latest 2024 Q1 branch of DeePMD-kit v3, was updated and uploaded to the AIS-Square website: https://aissquare.com/models/detail?pageType=models&name=DPA-2.1.0-2024Q1&id=244. Tests confirmed that migrating the code to DeePMD-kit v3 did not affect model accuracy. Additionally, tasks like ANI-1x and Transition-1x, previously used as downstream test sets, were included in the pre-trained model, and more extensive training improved model accuracy.

The system was updated with usage guides for zero-shot, single-task fine-tuning, and multi-task fine-tuning with pre-trained models. For any questions on model usage, community members can connect with developers in the GitHub discussion forum: https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/discussions/3772.
