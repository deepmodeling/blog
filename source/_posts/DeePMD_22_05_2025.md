At 3 AM in the laboratory, the hum of the centrifuge sounds like a countdown. You stare at the 42nd set of repeated experimental data, and the spring of the pipette makes a tired clicking sound — these hands that once solved the most difficult problems in the college entrance examination are now trapped in day-to-day mechanical operations.

We have seen too many talents' inspiration worn away by repetitive labor: the girl who developed lower back pain from standing in front of the fume hood could have designed an intelligent temperature control algorithm for the reactor; the boy who was scolded by his supervisor for manual pipetting errors should have already written a program to automatically calibrate the pipette.

AI has arrived, and the era of AI for Science (AI4S) is here. We are beginning to see a different future and witnessing the rise of automated and intelligent laboratories. However, compared to the 100,000 traditional biochemistry, environment, and materials laboratories, how many new laboratories can be built? Compared to the millions of graduate students in biochemistry, environment, and materials experiments, how many can obtain tickets to the intelligent era?
We asked Bohrium Science Navigation:https://cn.bing.com/search?q=%23%E5%B0%8F%E7%A8%8B%E5%BA%8F%3A%2F%2F%E7%8E%BB%E5%B0%94Bohrium%2FKWamiuZ0nOfDwCr&cvid=0baa952d3bba4943a76dcb29d8d86206&aqs=edge..69i57.800j0j1&pglt=43&FORM=ANNTA1&PC=LCTS

In April 2025, we launched the intelligent laboratory open-source operating system Uni-Lab-OS — this is not a cold collection of codes, but a "nerve center" that awakens experimental equipment — reactors begin to autonomously adjust parameters like old craftsmen, with temperature fluctuations reduced by 80% compared to manual control; pipetting workstations can autonomously learn your operation habits, and the laboratory at 3 AM finally no longer requires physical attendance...

The open-source and open Uni-Lab-OS hopes to explore a different path — **the community route of AI4S. AI4S brings not just the rise of a few new laboratories, but an efficiency revolution for 100,000 traditional laboratories! It's not just the honor of a few academic stars, but the youth breakthrough for millions of graduate students in biochemistry, environment, and materials experiments!**

Today, Uni-Lab-OS launches the Laboratory Breakthrough Plan — for students in biochemistry, environment, and materials laboratory research groups, we not only provide free intelligent laboratory transformation courses for everyone but also offer **￥10000~50000** in targeted support for each selected laboratory transformation plan, so that every scientific research dream has the opportunity to break through!

Features of the Laboratory Breakthrough Plan:

* **Scientific Research Crowd Innovation:** Guided by the real needs of research groups, encouraging the design of "leveraging small efforts to achieve great results" AI + hardware automation transformation plans.
* **Growth Closed Loop:** From course learning → plan design → engineering implementation → result sharing, the whole process is equipped with an integrated "teaching - learning - research - application" platform.
* **Inclusive Support:** From the prototype design of instruments and equipment to the overall improvement of research efficiency, each innovative plan is polished with targeted refinement, with the goal of achieving 50% automation of repetitive labor and forming an open AI knowledge base.


This is not just a simple equipment update but a paradigm shift in scientific research thinking. We look forward to witnessing: when 100,000 beakers are equipped with AI wings, and when millions of data flow into intelligent trajectories, the spark of Chinese scientific research will start a prairie fire in a new posture!

Relying on the rich software and hardware resources of Bohrium Research Space Station, we plan to carry out an AI4S instrument transformation and upgrading community project for undergraduates and postgraduates in science and engineering majors such as biochemistry, environment, and materials during the 2025 summer vacation. This project provides completely free AI4S-related training for students, aiming to help students achieve laboratory intelligent transformation at a low cost through systematic teaching and lay a path of advancement for students' research and career development.
